    <p>If you would enjoy a satisfying finale to your luxirous fine dining; look no further than this dessert.</p>
    <p>It contains a bowl of fruit loops in a bowl of milk. Now if you're feeling extra fancy, we can substitute it for 2% milk with no charge! And for those on a diet, we offer water instead of the milk for a $10 fee.</p>

        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Fruit Loops</li>
        <li>Optional: Spoon</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Get a bowl and place the milk in first.</li>
        <li>Afterwards, put the fruit loops into the bowl. Make sure you put the fruit loops after the milk is already in the bowl.</li>
        <li>Get a spoon and serve!</li>
    </ol>
